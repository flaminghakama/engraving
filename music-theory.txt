Sound manifests as pressue waves of air, vibrating at various frequencies.  

Freqency describes how quicky a vibration occurs, in terms of how many times it goes back and forth within a span of time, typically measured in cyles per second (Hz)

Scientifically, we can analyze any sound according to the relative strength of different frequencies.  

In general, any note played on a tonal instrument can be characterized according to a fundamental frequency which is the loudest, as well as additional higher frequencies that are softer.  These higher frequecies present in musical instrument sounds are called overtones.

The difference in sound between different instruments such as a flute vs. a violin vs. a trumpet vs. a voice lies in the relative strengths of the overtones.

Each note played by an tuned instrument corresponds to a frequency that maps to a pitch name.  Such as "A 440" 

Playing any note will generate frequencies 

Interval: Octave
Interval: Fifth
Interval: Fourth

Symmetry says:  Pick a note.  Using this note as a fundamental, it will generate the note a 5th above it.  Likewise, there is another fundamental note below our note, which will generate our note as the 5th above itself.
