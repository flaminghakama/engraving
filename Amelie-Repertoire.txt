Amelie Repertoire

It is mostly a standards gig 
although I do some originals 
and some less common covers

If you want to learn
anything new you are welcome

but we can pare this down
to the ones you know and like 

I read from a tablet 
in concert pitch 
so we can share that 

Here is a list of tunes 
I've played on the gig there 
over the months

They recently asked all the bands
to play more upbeat 
so probably not many of the ballads
