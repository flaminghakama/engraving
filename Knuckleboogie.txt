Since I don't have any gigs on Thursday, February 22

I am proposing that we rehearse at my studio

Flaming Hakama 
1890 Bryant St. #313
SF 94110

Say 7-9 or thereabouts we can figure out the exact timing in person 


My goals include:

1) Discuss songs and categorize songs 

* Songs we regularly play and want to keep playing 
* Songs we regularly play that we don't want to keep playing
* Songs we have played once or twice that we would like to play more
* Songs we have played once or twice that we don't want to ever play again
* Songs we have not yet played that we want to play

2) Figure out keys and arrangements

3) Rehearse the songs and arrangements we want to learn



Ideally, we can do the first point about discussing material beforehand

Towards that end, here is a list of basically everthing we've played over the past 4 months, in roughly chronological order of how recently we played it.
