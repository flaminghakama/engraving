Corpus Y

high-class speakeasy
organic human 
inspired by post-mid-century Jazz


quirky melodies with character

SNL band and Chick Corea slammed together

aural haze in the sound
through the haze diff personality types ghostly shit
really well orchestrated

Misty Forrest and Indiana Jones


jam band psychedelic in the context of a perfectly planned 
staircase fall and in-the-moment teamwork really well thought-out

takes you on a clear journey yet you cannot help but get caught up in a
a journey on which you don't get lost but a crazy urban map


chameleon bass with classical sound and other styles

intellectual backround social music 
headphone listening guilty pleasure
both sides of the brain
like a book on tape 
had depth

        https://altjazz.org/scores/journeythem-instrumentals/modern-jazz-setlist-for-C.html


I like the way we play the Inaugural Jazz material, and I think we should add the song Subversion
https://altjazz.org/scores/inaugural-jazz/subversion/subversion-Lead-Sheet-for-C.pdf

I also think we play the Exploring Jazz Traditions material well, and I would like to try the song Windows
https://altjazz.org/scores/jazz-combustion/windows/windows-Lead-Sheet-for-C.pdf

The Modern Jazz album material was not as successful.  I think we should keep As It Was, But I am not convinced that we should keep playing The Maze/State.  While we did learn to play it, I don't think it suits us well.  Likewise, I don't think we should attempt The Call (From A Redhead) since it is similarly very challenging and not in our pocket.  However, I would be curious to try two other songs from that album

Nancy https://altjazz.org/scores/journeythem-instrumentals/nancy/nancy-Lead-Sheet-for-C.pdf
Stomping Ground https://altjazz.org/scores/journeythem-instrumentals/stomping-ground/stomping-ground-Lead-Sheet-for-C.pdf


Then material from later albums that I think we should consider

I think the Inaugural Jazz and Exploring Jazz Traditions material is solid, and things we can play on gigs.  

From the Modern material, I am not sure we'll have many opportunities to play for the death of my friends, and I am not convined that Nancy suits us well, so I think we may not continue with those two.


In terms of additional material to consider, here are ones I'd like to consider
