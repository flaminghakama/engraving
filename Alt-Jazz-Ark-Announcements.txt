There is some chance I'll be 
taking part in this 
nautanki production 
by the Devendra Sharma 
Folk Opera Ensemble 

featuring artists
Pandit Ram Dayal Sharma
and Nathi Lal Yadav 

Princess Nautanki is a 
multi-lingual musical theater 
inspired by a classic Indian story
which inspired the genre

The performance features 
a woman Hero going 
against her father 

physically fighting and 
defeating men in combat 

a man crossdressing to get 
closer to a woman's heart

undertones of gay erotic love 
and the class-caste divide.
