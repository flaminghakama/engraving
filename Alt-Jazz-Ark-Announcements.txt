Corpus Recording Update
Jam Session Hiatus



Welcome to 
another installment of
Alt Jazz Ark Announcements

This month we have some 
updates on recording projects

Please note that Mercury Cafe 
is taking a break from hosting 
Thursday night music 
from now through July 

Summer is upon us and 
Alt Jazz Ark Trio will be 
performing as part of 
Noise Pop Summer of Music




Corpus X Quartet

The sessions with Corpus X
started shaky with a 
last-minute reshcheduling 
and fewer total studio hours

They almost got entirely scrapped 
when I discovered while 
setting up that the piano's 
G above middle C was broken

Fortunately I was able to 
fix it after dead-of-night 
youtubing learning how to 
remove the fallboard 


In 10 hours, we managed
to record all 12 songs 
we intended to record 

The band enjoyed the sessions
and I think we layed down 
some fine material

The band was very consistent
and well prepared 

Our repertoire is original material
but the song forms and arrangments 
are largely traditional which means 
we are highlighting the improvisation


I've completed listening,
selecting takes, and doing
rough mixes

But these deserve more polish 
so I will release them in a few weeks

Corpus X is taking a bit of a hiatus
but will return in advance of 
an October gig at Comstock Saloon



Corpus Y Quartet

The sessions with Corpus Y 
lasted were also productive 

In 6 hours, we recorded 
9 out of 10 songs we 
intended to record plus 
one take of Benjamin's 
Giant Stella

The Corpus Y material is 
less traditional with 
more mixed meter and 
multi-genre styles 

For that reason
these recordings focus 
more on the compositions 
than on impovisation


We are still in the 
critical listening phase 
of evaluating this work 

But all in all 
a lot of great sounds
