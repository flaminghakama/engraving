The band Children Of Lucy 
had a first performance 
at the new Bissap Baobab
in January and they 
quicky invited us back

This Senegalese restaurant 
is a great venue for our
Afro/Indian dance tunes
and originals by Dr. Clock
aka A. C. Lewis

    A.C. Lewis - drums
    Jonah Cabral - alto saxophone
    Elaine Alt - tenor saxophone
    David El - guitar 
    Alex Holloway - bass 
    Mar Stevens - percussion
    Eric Scheide - percussion 

With MAPP SF happening, 
should be a great time to
dance, listen, eat, and 
meet other wandering 
neighborhood folks

The Weekend Crew at 
Sheba Jazz Lounge

Our first set starts off 
with Swing from the 1930s and 1940s
and progresses to Bebop, 
Hard Bop, and what Greer 
likes to call "the Latin shit"

    Elaine Alt - baritone saxophone
    Greer Rockett - trumpet
    Manny Berry - piano
    Rob Bassinette - bass
    Garry Williams - drums

The Sheba events calendar 
lists the Sunday band as
Bohemian Knuckleboogie

Which was the name of the 
band started many years ago 
led by Al

For some reason they 
like to keep the name
even though Al retired
and there is all new 
personnel except for Garry

Yet, when we play on 
Saturdays, they like to 
list us as the Sunday Crew

I can't say it makes 
sense but regrardless 
of the name

We are keeping Jazz alive 
in the Fillmore, the 
Harlem of the West
